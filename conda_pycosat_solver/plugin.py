    This checks the plugin manager's actual hook results rather than
    comparing ``conda.__version__`` against a cutoff: a dev/pre-release build
    of conda's classic-removal work can report a version that sorts *before*
    the release it belongs to (e.g. ``26.10.0.dev5`` sorts below ``26.10``),
    even though that exact build already stopped loading the classic solver.
    Version comparison can't distinguish that case from an actual pre-26.10
    release, so it's not a reliable signal here.

    Uses ``subset_hook_caller`` to exclude this module's own ``conda_solvers``
    hookimpl from the call, since this function is itself called from within
    that hookimpl -- calling the unfiltered hook here would recurse into it.
